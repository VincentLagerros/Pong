This is the Pong game that makes a game with 3 windows.

Note: The code is a little bit spagett and I don't really know if it works on other machines. 
Currently you must launch the game 3 times, but this can be solved with os.execute([command])
This project used save files to communicate, this is not efficient.

This game was just for shits and giggles.
